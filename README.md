- Getting started (with demo app)

## Notes

```csharp
if( BaseUrl != null
// According to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/22718
// this is the proper cross-platform way to check whether a uri is absolute or not:
&& Uri.TryCreate( content, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute, out var contentUri )
&& !contentUri.IsAbsoluteUri )
{
content = new Uri( BaseUrl, contentUri ).AbsoluteUri;
}
```
